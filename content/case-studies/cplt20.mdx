## Overview 

[![](/img/frogbox-color.jpg)]()

### Problem
The cricket division was tasked with supplying a match centre to the CPL, whilst also with the intention of white labelling the product. With increasing levels of top level competition tournaments, and an already healthy market of match centres, we needed to offer a user-friendly and efficient solution that would impress users enough to return, and in turn increase user engagement & retention.

### Solution
We looked to build out core components and functionality for a match centre that could be used across different clients, whilst offering a best-in-class  experience. We conducted competitive analysis to identify core elements, and then analysed for functionality offering to ensure we could compete.

### My Role
I led the UX research and design on this project building out deliverables including Experience benchmarks, UI designs, Interaction design and Prototypes with the close help of the product owner,  dev team and wider cricket division.
